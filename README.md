# Clustering-Methods

## Objective
The goal of this project is to implement some expectation maximization algorithm such as KMeans and Gaussian Mixtures.
Both methods will be implemented from scratch using Pytorch.
During this experiment, we will try to gain some insights about the difference between KMeans and GMM.

## Data
The data has been generated using numpy to fit the purpose of showing the performance of both algorithms.

## Setup
In order to install the conda environment needed to run the notebook, run the following line:
```console
conda env create --file requirements.yml
conda activate torch
```

## Notebook
The experiment can be found in the notebook at the root of the project.
